# Hello-world
Anything Flying related - RC at the moment.


I work as a DBA (Database Administrator) but have a passion for flying. I have a vision limitation that prevents me from flying the raal thing, so I have to settle for RC. To that end, I plan on simulating as much as I can with RC. At the moment that will entale building a Sim-Pit I can take to the field, with HOTAS, Rudder, & Head tracker.
